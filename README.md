# Sea-Level-Rise-Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting sea level rise in the Manila South Harbor using advanced time series analysis techniques. The SARIMA model takes into account both the temporal patterns and seasonality of sea level data, enabling accurate predictions. By leveraging the historical data available, this predictive model offers valuable information for understanding potential sea level changes and their implications.

## Data Source

The sea level data used for this analysis was obtained from the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) dataset. The dataset can be accessed [here](https://psmsl.org/data/obtaining/rlr.monthly.data/145.rlrdata). It includes historical monthly sea level measurements, which have been utilized to train and validate the SARIMA model.
